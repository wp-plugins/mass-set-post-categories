Set posts to categories all at once

== Description ==

This plugin lists all your posts and displays checkboxes for all your currently registered categories.  You can check or uncheck categories and then hit any one of the submit buttons and your posts will be put into the categories you've chosen

*   I've used this for 200 posts.  I dont really know what will happen if you try to change 2000 posts at a time.
*   I am going to try to implement a paging feature so that huge post lists wont crash anything.
*   The compatability i've listed simply means it's what i've used it on.  This will probly work on any >3 wp version.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= It's cool, but can you make it do [this feature]? =

Yeah, I prolly can.  You can contact me and maybe I'll do it for free if I have time and think its a good idea.  Otherwise, you can hire me to do it.

= It dont work =

I fixed it, sorry bout that.

= Whatcha got in the trunk? =

Oh... You don't wanna look in there.

= Lobotomy? Isn't that for loonies? =

Not at all. Friend of mine had one. Designer of the neutron bomb. You ever hear of the neutron bomb? Destroys people - leaves buildings standing. Fits in a suitcase. It's so small, no one knows it's there until - BLAMMO. Eyes melt, skin explodes, everybody dead. So immoral, working on the thing can drive you mad. That's what happened to this friend of mine. So he had a lobotomy. Now he's well again.
